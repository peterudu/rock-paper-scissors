### Colour Scheme
The general aim is to make the game look simple and in this context the text content are coloured black on a white background. Brighter colours are used to differentiate between the actions of the player and that of the opponent computer as such a light blue colour defines the player area and red colour is used for the computer actions. The contrasting colour mix of white and black as well as light blue are used to present the basic face of the website.
