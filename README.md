# Rock Paper Scissors

The Rock Paper Scissors website is a simple game application which visitors can easily learn and play with a short period. The rules of the game are included on the page.

The graphics of the game are basic and this makes it appealing to all age groups and enables the user of the application to easily focus on enjoying the game.

## Design
### Colour Scheme
The general aim is to make the game look simple and in this context the text content are coloured black on a white background. Brighter colours are used to differentiate between the actions of the player and that of the opponent computer as such a light blue colour defines the player area and red colour is used for the computer actions. The contrasting colour mix of white and black as well as light blue are used to present the basic face of the website.

The colour choice was aided using the [webfx color-picker](https://www.webfx.com/web-design/color-picker/ ) tool

### Typography
